This is some work that was based on:
[Yehuda Katz presentation: "Off the Menu: Building a Client-Side With Ember and Rails" at Rails Isreal 2014](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpQj9_qEUAc)

This is an example rails 4 application that uses ember.js.

There are more than a couple discrepencies from the presentation and this presentation. One big one is that this is using CoffeeScript. I put this together for my own educational purposes. I just hoped that this might help someone else.
